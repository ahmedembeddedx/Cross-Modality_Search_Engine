# Multi-Modal Search Engine

This project is a Multi-Modal Search Engine developed using CLIP by OpenAI, with Flask API for backend and React for the frontend web application.

## Introduction

The Multi-Modal Search Engine leverages the power of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) developed by OpenAI to enable users to search for images using natural language queries. This project provides a seamless web interface where users can input text queries, and the system retrieves relevant images based on the textual description.

## Features

- **Multi-Modal Search:** Users can input textual descriptions of images to retrieve relevant images.
- **Intuitive Web Interface:** The frontend is built using React to provide a user-friendly experience.
- **Scalable Backend:** Flask API serves as the backend, handling requests and interacting with the CLIP model.
